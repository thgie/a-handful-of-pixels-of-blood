It is the end product of a three-year research project conducted by the INTEGRAE team, and is divided into three parts. Part 1 contextualizes the research on graphics and visuality within game studies, notably through the opposition between fiction and rules and the difficulties in finding common vocabulary to discuss key visual concepts such as perspective and point of view. Part 2 discusses a number of visual traditions through which we frame video game graphics (film, animation, art history, graphical projection and technical drawing), highlighting their relevance and shortcomings in addressing the long history of video games and the very different paradigms of 2D and 3D graphics. Part 3 presents the Game FAVR, a model that allows any game’s visual representation to be described and discussed through a common frame and vocabulary. The framework is presented in an accessible manner and is organized as a toolkit, with sample case studies, templates, and a flowchart for using the FAVR provided as an annex1, so that researchers and students can immediately start using it.},

Software is a tangle, a knot, which ties together the physical and the ephemeral, the material and the ethereal, into a complete system that can be controlled and directed. However, software exceeds our ability to place limits on its entanglement, for it has in the past decade entered the everyday home through electronic augmentation that has replaced the mechanical world of the twentieth century. From washing machines to central heating systems, children's toys to television and video; the old electro-magnetic and servo-mechanical world is being revolutionised by the silent logic of virtual devices.

Videogames use resources from the fertile field of popular culture, exploiting models, pre-worked materials, well-known heroes, stereotypes, and myths. Since genres have multiple meanings, functions, production models and audience expectations that evolve through time, it is important to understand if a videogame genre framework exists or if there are just labels or marketing tools used by the game producers. Finding out if there is a blueprint for videogame genres requires the understanding of specific elements and their arrangement. Being aware that it is not possible to present an exhaustive genre categorization but only a general structure of the videogame genres, this paper uses the genres’ framework identified by Aaretsh, Smedstad and Sunnanå (2003) and integrates interviews with professionals. It also reviews the general and the specific genre literature and analyses the role and the characteristics of several elements that articulate the videogame genres.},

Until recently, spectating has remained an analytical domain of film theory and visual arts. In game studies, this perspective has changed, with the arrival of the phenomenon of gameplay spectating and game streaming on a mass scale, and its leakage into academic as well as popular consciousness. How does the spectacle change the analytical perspective towards video games as objects of scholarly analysis and video gaming as reflective practice? In this paper, I will approach the video game as an algorithmic spectacle and propose an analytical perspective to study this phenomenon, reaching out to theories of moving (digital) image proposed by the philosopher Vilém Flusser and the filmmaker Harun Farocki.},

Par l’intermédiaire du concept de ludème, dont l’évolution particulière symbolise pleinement la problématique dans son ensemble, la réflexion menée montrera finalement qu’il est possible de réarticuler celle-ci sur différents niveaux d’analyses, pour y concilier les différents aspects de la conception et du jouer, et qu'elle peut également être repensée pour apporter un nouvel éclairage sur des questions d’expérience de jeu, de gameplay émergent ou encore de détournement.},

We explicitly reformulate the layers as learning residual functions with reference to the layer inputs, instead of learning unreferenced functions. We provide comprehensive empirical evidence showing that these residual networks are easier to optimize, and can gain accuracy from considerably increased depth. On the ImageNet dataset we evaluate residual nets with a depth of up to 152 layers---8x deeper than VGG nets but still having lower complexity. An ensemble of these residual nets achieves 3.57\% error on the ImageNet test set. This result won the 1st place on the ILSVRC 2015 classification task. We also present analysis on CIFAR-10 with 100 and 1000 layers. The depth of representations is of central importance for many visual recognition tasks. Solely due to our extremely deep representations, we obtain a 28\% relative improvement on the COCO object detection dataset. Deep residual nets are foundations of our submissions to ILSVRC \& COCO 2015 competitions, where we also won the 1st places on the tasks of ImageNet detection, ImageNet localization, COCO detection, and COCO segmentation.},

La création de jeux vidéo, parce qu’elle est traversée par le jeu et l’interaction, est un terrain de choix pour apporter une contribution originale aux études des pratiques culturelles. C’est là son principal intérêt scientifique, qui trouve son origine dans la situation nécessairement intermédiaire des amateurs. Ces derniers naviguent entre jeu, création de jeu et jeu de création. Il y a alors une occasion unique de revisiter, au-delà même du jeu vidéo, notre compréhension des productions amateur : les « joueurs » sont-ils les seuls à jouer ? Les photographes et les cinéastes ne semblent pas être les derniers à jouer avec leurs appareils : mais alors à quoi jouent-ils ? Et qu’est-ce que ce jeu nous dit de leur processus créatif ? Nous apporterons au moins deux réponses, qui se rejoignent et qui imprègnent cette recherche de manière transversale. D’abord, c’est que l’acte de jouer est un acte intime nécessairement orienté vers le joueur lui-même. On ne joue jamais que pour soi (et pourtant, parfois, ce faisant, on crée pour un autre). Ensuite, c’est qu’il n’y a pas de jeu sans amour, ou du moins sans plaisir. On mettra à l’épreuve, dans ce travail, un critère définitoire du jeu aussi évident que délaissé, et loin d’être simple à étudier : si l’on joue, c’est par goût. Aussi, quand les amateurs créent du jeu, ils continuent de travailler leur goût. Mais, à nouveau : on ne peut jamais goûter que pour soi-même. Jouer et goûter : tout nous ramène à un faire pour soi dont l’articulation à un faire pour l’autre s’annonce problématique. Nous touchons là à l’ambition de ce travail : comprendre un agir culturel qui est profondément intime et personnel, sans abandonner la compréhension de ses modalités de partage – structurellement et nécessairement complexes."

As the author notes, code's "meaning is not determined entirely by the programmer's intention but also by how it is received and recirculated. That is not to argue that code can be taken out of context or that code means whatever people say it means but rather that the meaning of code is contingent and that code is subject to the rhetorical triad of speaker, audience (both human and machine), and message." It is time to develop methods of tracing the meaning of code. Computer source code has become part of our political, legal, aesthetic, and popular discourse. Code is being read by lawyers, corporate managers, artists, pundits, reporters, and even literary scholars. Code is being used in political debate, in artistic exhibitions, in popular entertainment, and in historical accounts. As code reaches more and more readers and as programming languages and methods continue to evolve, we need to develop methods to account for the way code accrues meaning and how the readers and shifting contexts shape that meaning. We need to learn not only to understand the functioning of code but the way code signifies. We need to learn to read code critically. Critical Code Studies offers a CCS "starting kit," a set of techniques that scholars and other interested parties can use to interpret code in a non-computational context"--},

The ontology aims at advancing the mechanisms for understanding and classify games based on their features, ultimately offering new insights and opportunities in the field of game development.

  abstract = {The recent breakthroughs in natural language processing for model pretraining on large quantities of data have opened the way for similar foundation models in computer vision. These models could greatly simplify the use of images in any system by producing all-purpose visual features, i.e., features that work across image distributions and tasks without finetuning. This work shows that existing pretraining methods, especially self-supervised methods, can produce such features if trained on enough curated data from diverse sources. We revisit existing approaches and combine different techniques to scale our pretraining in terms of data and model size. Most of the technical contributions aim at accelerating and stabilizing the training at scale. In terms of data, we propose an automatic pipeline to build a dedicated, diverse, and curated image dataset instead of uncurated data, as typically done in the self-supervised literature. In terms of models, we train a ViT model (Dosovitskiy et al., 2020) with 1B parameters and distill it into a series of smaller models that surpass the best available all-purpose features, OpenCLIP (Ilharco et al., 2021) on most of the benchmarks at image and pixel levels.},

  abstract = {In the field of computer vision (CV), image segmentation technology, as a fundamental part, has a crucial impact on the accuracy of subsequent image processing tasks. Image segmentation is not only a crucial transitional step from image processing to image analysis, but also a hot and difficult research topic in the field of CV. Although significant progress has been made in the research of image segmentation algorithms, existing segmentation algorithms may still face challenges in certain specific scenarios due to the complexity and diversity of images, making it difficult to achieve ideal segmentation results. In recent years, the rapid development of deep learning (DL) technology has brought new breakthroughs to the field of image segmentation. DL models, especially Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs), can capture semantic information of images more accurately by automatically learning feature representations in images, thereby achieving more precise image segmentation. This article delves into the research and application of image segmentation algorithms in CV, with a focus on the application of DL in the field of image segmentation. With the continuous development of advanced technologies such as DL, it is believed that image segmentation technology will play a greater role in more fields in the future.},

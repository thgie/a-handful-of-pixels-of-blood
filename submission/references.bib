  abstract = {This paper lays out a unified framework of the ergodic animage, the rule-based and interactiondriven part of visual representation in video games. It is the end product of a three-year research project conducted by the INTEGRAE team, and is divided into three parts. Part 1 contextualizes the research on graphics and visuality within game studies, notably through the opposition between fiction and rules and the difficulties in finding common vocabulary to discuss key visual concepts such as perspective and point of view. Part 2 discusses a number of visual traditions through which we frame video game graphics (film, animation, art history, graphical projection and technical drawing), highlighting their relevance and shortcomings in addressing the long history of video games and the very different paradigms of 2D and 3D graphics. Part 3 presents the Game FAVR, a model that allows any game’s visual representation to be described and discussed through a common frame and vocabulary. The framework is presented in an accessible manner and is organized as a toolkit, with sample case studies, templates, and a flowchart for using the FAVR provided as an annex1, so that researchers and students can immediately start using it.},

  abstract = {Video game analyses have historically focused on the human act of play or on the events resulting from the player’s act. Until recently, spectating has remained an analytical domain of film theory and visual arts. In game studies, this perspective has changed, with the arrival of the phenomenon of gameplay spectating and game streaming on a mass scale, and its leakage into academic as well as popular consciousness. How does the spectacle change the analytical perspective towards video games as objects of scholarly analysis and video gaming as reflective practice? In this paper, I will approach the video game as an algorithmic spectacle and propose an analytical perspective to study this phenomenon, reaching out to theories of moving (digital) image proposed by the philosopher Vilém Flusser and the filmmaker Harun Farocki.},

The individual chapters pose questions relating to the status, ontology and aesthetics of such practices and phenomena and also analyse their cultural and artistic significance. Artistic works explore these questions in the form of various image practices. The authors and artists investigate the potential for a new area of research at the intersection of a range of disciplines, such as media studies, media aesthetics, media history, image studies, photography theory, game studies, media art and game art. As one of the first publications to address these phenomena, this book speaks to a varied audience in the realms of media studies, game studies and cultural studies as well as to members of the general public interested in historical and contemporary practices associated with visual and digital media.},

  abstract = {Deeper neural networks are more difficult to train. We present a residual learning framework to ease the training of networks that are substantially deeper than those used previously. We explicitly reformulate the layers as learning residual functions with reference to the layer inputs, instead of learning unreferenced functions. We provide comprehensive empirical evidence showing that these residual networks are easier to optimize, and can gain accuracy from considerably increased depth. On the ImageNet dataset we evaluate residual nets with a depth of up to 152 layers---8x deeper than VGG nets but still having lower complexity. An ensemble of these residual nets achieves 3.57\% error on the ImageNet test set. This result won the 1st place on the ILSVRC 2015 classification task. We also present analysis on CIFAR-10 with 100 and 1000 layers. The depth of representations is of central importance for many visual recognition tasks. Solely due to our extremely deep representations, we obtain a 28\% relative improvement on the COCO object detection dataset. Deep residual nets are foundations of our submissions to ILSVRC \& COCO 2015 competitions, where we also won the 1st places on the tasks of ImageNet detection, ImageNet localization, COCO detection, and COCO segmentation.},

It also addresses the ever-changing works of game programmers, who strive to exceed the limits derived from the classification mechanisms based on labels and title genres. With respect to the state-of-the-art, the ontology additionally permits to infer the categories of a game through the features of its dynamics and mechanics, such as the point of view (POV) or game-play elements. Furthermore, it encompasses programmers, final users, software programs, and devices in its ontological model. The ontology aims at advancing the mechanisms for understanding and classify games based on their features, ultimately offering new insights and opportunities in the field of game development. In this context, the ontology can be leveraged to represent any agent in the video-game domain such as players, bots, related actions and game strategies.},

  abstract = {The recent breakthroughs in natural language processing for model pretraining on large quantities of data have opened the way for similar foundation models in computer vision. These models could greatly simplify the use of images in any system by producing all-purpose visual features, i.e., features that work across image distributions and tasks without finetuning. This work shows that existing pretraining methods, especially self-supervised methods, can produce such features if trained on enough curated data from diverse sources. We revisit existing approaches and combine different techniques to scale our pretraining in terms of data and model size. Most of the technical contributions aim at accelerating and stabilizing the training at scale. In terms of data, we propose an automatic pipeline to build a dedicated, diverse, and curated image dataset instead of uncurated data, as typically done in the self-supervised literature. In terms of models, we train a ViT model (Dosovitskiy et al., 2020) with 1B parameters and distill it into a series of smaller models that surpass the best available all-purpose features, OpenCLIP (Ilharco et al., 2021) on most of the benchmarks at image and pixel levels.},

  abstract = {In the field of computer vision (CV), image segmentation technology, as a fundamental part, has a crucial impact on the accuracy of subsequent image processing tasks. Image segmentation is not only a crucial transitional step from image processing to image analysis, but also a hot and difficult research topic in the field of CV. Although significant progress has been made in the research of image segmentation algorithms, existing segmentation algorithms may still face challenges in certain specific scenarios due to the complexity and diversity of images, making it difficult to achieve ideal segmentation results. In recent years, the rapid development of deep learning (DL) technology has brought new breakthroughs to the field of image segmentation. DL models, especially Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs), can capture semantic information of images more accurately by automatically learning feature representations in images, thereby achieving more precise image segmentation. This article delves into the research and application of image segmentation algorithms in CV, with a focus on the application of DL in the field of image segmentation. With the continuous development of advanced technologies such as DL, it is believed that image segmentation technology will play a greater role in more fields in the future.},
